# Use Postmarks!

A simple landing page for the [Postmarks](https://github.com/ckolderup/postmarks) project.

## Acknowledgements

Postmarks was created by [Casey Kolderup](https://sharetron.com/@casey).

This project uses assets from Postmarks, so the same acknowledgements apply...

- The "Postmarks" name is compliments of [Casey C](https://sowe.li) (no relation to Casey K), who brainstormed dozens of ideas for the name when Casey was first trying to rename the project. 
- The Postmarks logo uses an edited version of Eynav Raphael's ["Postmark Stamp"](https://thenounproject.com/icon/postmark-stamp-928917/) icon from The Noun Project.
- It also makes use of free fonts including [Averia Sans](http://iotic.com/averia/) and [Public Sans](https://public-sans.digital.gov/).

The Use Postmarks site was built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
